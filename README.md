## About Insight OS

Insight OS is an open-source, AI-powered writing platform designed to help writers of all levels create better content. Built on a foundation of advanced language models and intuitive design, Insight OS provides intelligent writing assistance, real-time feedback, and collaborative tools to enhance your writing process.

This repository contains the core platform where our community of writers, developers, and AI researchers collaborate to build the future of intelligent writing assistance. We publish our [development roadmap](https://github.com/abdurmasood/vswrite/wiki/Roadmap), [feature releases](https://github.com/abdurmasood/vswrite/releases), and maintain open communication about our vision for AI-assisted writing.

The platform is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt), ensuring it remains free and accessible to writers everywhere.
